# C++ Programming

I am creating videos on C++ programming. These videos require you to have at least 2 years of C++ programming experience. You are welcomed to watch the videos and give me feedbacks. The videos on youtube are in fairly high resolution. If they appear fuzzy, increase your Youtube video quality setting.
